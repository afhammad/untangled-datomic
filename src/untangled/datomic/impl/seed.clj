         :refattr  tempid | realid

  Any scalar values will be used literally. Any database ID can be either a real
  datomic entity ID, or a :tempid/name placeholder. Using the same :tempid/name
  placeholder in multiple entities within a transaction will result in the exact
  same tempid when joined into a real transaction.

  As with normal entity maps in datomic, you may put values for many fields as
  a set, including tempids:

       { :db/id :tempid/myid
         :attr  value
         :refattrs #{ tempid realid realid tempid }
       }

  The primary purpose of this macro is to validate and add metadata to the entity.

  datomic and remembers the association in the returned map.

  If the item is a map and the id-map already contains a mapping for the item,
  then this function will throw an AssertionError that includes the metadata of
  the item in question, which will include the file/line if the entity was
  created via the generate-entity macro.

  If the item is a datomic datom list, then no duplicate checking is applied, and
  new ids will be added to the map, while repeat entries will be ignored.
