; # Custom Validation of Datomic Transactions
;
; Datomic itself supports the following schema validations out of the box:
;
; * Correct field type
; * References (the only ON DELETE behavior is nullify)
;
; Our schema support adds the following (opt-in) validation enforcement:
;
; * Entities have a more definitive "kind", with a limited set of attributes defined by the schema.
; * References point to the right "kind" of entity. Normally, Datomic types are advisory (any attribute can go on
;   any entity. To enforce this we need to have a way to determine the "type" of an entity.
;
; The functions in this namespace implement these additions.
;
; The "implied" kind of an entity is the common namespace of a set of attributes (e.g. user). Since some
; arbitrary entity will have at least one of those properties when it is behaving as a user, we can
; derive the "kind" of an entity if we also declare which properties (e.g. :user/name) will *always*
; be on a "User". We call these attributes "definitive" (their presences define the "type" of the entity).
;
; Note that if you allow a foreign attribute  on an entity (e.g. :account/name on "user") and that
; foreign attribute is also definitive, then by placing both on an entity you're conferring that additional
; "type" on that entity (it is now an "account" and a "user"). This has additional validation implications
; (e.g. it can now be referred to by things that can refer to an account and a user). Conversely, removing
; such an attribute could cause validation to fail if such a removal would remove a "type" that other
; attributes or references rely on.
;
; ## Basic Operation
;
; The validation MUST be ACID compliant. Since the transactor is the only place that true ACID operations are possible,
; we must technically do some part of the validation there to ensure correctness. However, since the Datomic
; transactor is a limited resource (it is the single write thread for the entire database), we want to limit the
; overhead, and therefore adopt the following scheme for doing transactions:
;
; * First, do the full validation (correct attribute values, referential constraints correct) on the client. A
;   failure indicates no need to even *try* the real transaction. This also has the effect of pre-caching all the
;   relevant data in the peer.
; * Find the current database basis (transaction number)
; * Repeat the validation on the client/peer. The pre-cached data will make this attempt happen much more quickly than
; the first.
; * Attempt to apply a transaction *without validation*, but include a call to a database function the will throw an
; exception if the real database basis (transaction number) is different than what was read in step 2. If the transaction
; succeeds, then all is well since the database had not changed since the client validation.
; * IF the transaction fails, the database may be under too high of a write load for the optimistic approach above to
; succeed. So, instead apply the REFERENCE validations in the transactor. The attribute validations were already done
; on the client, so there is no need to repeat them in the transactor.
;
; This overall scheme is implemented by `vtransact`, which works the same as Datomic's `transact`, but does the validations
; as described above using additional data you associate with the schema.
;
; The transactor validations use support functions from this namespace, so this namespace MUST be on the transactor's
; CLASSPATH.
;
; Additionally, there are database functions you must install into your schema. See
; `untangled.datomic.impl.core-schema-definitions` for the code that installs the two transactor functions `ensure-version`
; and `constrained-transaction`.

(defn validate-transaction
  "
  Examines a transaction result to determine if the changes are valid. Throws exceptions if there are problems.

  ## Validation Algorithm:

  1. Find all of the entitied that were modified.
  - Entities whose attribute set changed
  - Entities that were updated due to reference 'nulling'
  2. Ignore any entities that were removed
  3. For every modified entity E:
  - Find all of the entities R that refer to E and verify that the references R->E are still valid
  - Verify that all references out of E are still valid
  - Derive the types T using definitive-attributes for E
  - Find all valid attributes A for T using schema
  - Verify that E contains only those attributes in A

  Parameters:
  `tx-result` - The return value of datomic `transact`, `with`, or similar function.
  `validate-attributes?` - Should the attributes be checkd? Defaults to false. Do NOT do in transactor, since it is costly.

  This function returns true if the changes are valid; otherwise it throws exceptions. When run within the transactor
  an exception will cause the transacation to abort, and this function is used by the client **and** the transactor
  db function.

  The thrown transaction will include the message 'Invalid References' if the transaction is invalid due to referential
  constraints. The message will include 'Invalid Attributes' if the transaction is invalid due to attributes on
  entities that are not allowed (e.g. a realm attribute on a user type).
